HeyðŸ‘‹, here I have past projects that iv'e been involved with during my time at Mission Ready, along with side projects of my own. Some may show that I know how to; work with ReactJS or NodeJS and a variety of open sourced frameworks also to collaborate in a team effectively, deploy web applications, carry out testing procedures during api development and containerize web applications.
