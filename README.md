The majority of past projects I have here in my portfolio, iv'e been involved with during my time studying at Mission Ready, along with side projects of my own. Some may show that I know how to:

- work with ReactJS, NodeJS & a variety of open sourced frameworks
- collaborate in a ðŸ‘¥team effectively
- deploy web applications
- carry out testing procedures during api development and ðŸ“¦containerize web applications.
